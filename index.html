  <h3>New App Prototype Project</h3><br>
  <p>Our assignment was to come up with an original app idea and develop it into a medium fidelity prototype. Testing our app along the way. Our team consisted of three members. Myself, the Team Lead; Ana Velarde, our Lead Designer; and Lauren Mcalister, our Head of Research.</p>

  <h3>Research</h3><br>
  <p>Our assignment was to come up with an original app idea and develop it into a medium fidelity prototype. Testing our app along the way. Before working on the prototype we had to do research on potential competitors that have similar or relatable apps in the market.</p>

  <h3>Interviews</h3>
  <p>The next step was developing user interview questions along with Subject Matter Experts interviews. These questions included: </p>
   <br>
     <p>Are there any music apps that you use?</p>
     <p>How do you find out about concerts in your area?</p>
     <p>How do you make plans for a weekend?</p>
     <p>Are there any apps you use to help plan events?</p>
     <p>What are things that you look for in mobile apps?</p>
     <p>What are some struggles when finding an event/concert?</p>
     <p>When making plans with friends how do you share event details?</p>
     <br>
     <p>This would be the information that we would base our human centered design on. Focusing on what the user needed and how to make sure all their needs were met successfully.</p>

  <h3>Discoveries</h3>
   <br>
     <p>Most users looked for apps that are easy to use and that are intuitive.</p>
     <p>When going out for the weekend they make little plans and tend to “go with the flow”.</p>
     <p>Only hear about popular bands through major music streaming sites.</p>
     <p>Some users were a little confused on what the app provided.</p>
    <br>
    <p>With this information we started wireframing for our Personas</p>

  <h3>Personas</h3><br>
  <p>After doing research and interviewing potential users we focused on Personas and Key Path Scenarios. Our main Persona is Michael, a 24 year old college grad working in IT Systems. He is a weekend user whose goals are to find the next up-in-coming bands and in the know. His frustration is over commercialized events. Alex is our Secondary Persona. She is 27 years old with a degree in marketing. Alex works for a bar/restaurant chain that she plans events for. Her goals are to keep new and regular customers coming in to her establishment. Her frustration is using social media sites that don't connect her with customers.</p>
  <p>Once we had our personas it was time to map out their key path when using the SoundSeek app.</p>

  <h3>First Prototype</h3>
  <p>Our first prototype focused less on the visual aspects of the design and more on the process users would be doing in order to achieve their tasks and goals. After testing with users we were able to take the feed back and apply it to our Final Prototype.</p>

<div class="container-fluid bg-3 text-center">
  <h3>Final Prototype</h3><br>
  <p>Below is the SoundSeek prototype path for our main persona Michael. This shows how he can find an event by filtering his search to by the energy, distance, and amenities. Here he selects a medium energy so not a full on rock concert but also not too quiet. He finds the a place called Noni's that may suit what he is looking for. We made a few changes from our first prototype including changing the color theme and the name of the app to SoundSeek. Other lesser changes included changes in wording and what information is displayed in the menu screen.</p>

  <p>Here we have the path for our secondary persona. Alex works at a restaurant/bar called Noni's and is posting a show the location is putting on with a local band. She is able to put the important information such as the date/time and an image of the band to peak user's interest.</p>
